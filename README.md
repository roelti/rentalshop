Release: 15-02-2018
-----------------------------
* Consult the User Manual (stored in the zip-file) first before contacting our support. You will find answers to common questions and other useful information there.
* Still experiencing problems? Make sure to send a WooCommerce system status report with your support ticket.
* Make sure to update Wordpress and WooCommerce regularly in order to prevent compatibility issues.
* It is recommended to reset the products and categories if you are currently using an outdated version of the plugin (especially if you are still using version 4.9.0 or older).
* The webshop plugin does not contain functionality to handle kits. Kits are handled as normal items and therefore the shown availability is incorrect. Because of this, kits are not correctly forwarded in the connected Rentman account. This is missing functionality that we will add in the future but not in the short term.
