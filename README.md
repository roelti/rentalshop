Rentman 4G WooCommerce Plugin - Version 4.11.1

Release: 15-03-2018
-----------------------------
After a long beta phase and extensive testing, the Rentman 4G WooCommerce plugin will not receive regular updates anymore. The User Manual (stored in the zip-file) contains an overview of frequently asked questions and answers. Unfortunately, support for the plugin will be limited. Customization of the plugin is mostly your own responsibility.

* Please attach a WooCommerce system status report to your support ticket if you are still experiencing problems after consulting the User Manual.
* Make sure to update Wordpress and WooCommerce regularly in order to prevent compatibility issues.
* It is recommended to reset the products and categories if you are currently using an outdated version of the plugin (especially if you are still using version 4.9.0 or older).
* The webshop plugin does not contain functionality to handle kits. Kits are handled as normal items and therefore the shown availability is incorrect. Because of this, kits are not correctly forwarded in the connected Rentman account. This is missing functionality that we will add in the future but not in the short term.
