Installation process
-----------------------------
1. If you already have an older version (lower then 4.20.0) of the plugin installed
we recommend to deactivate and delete this first.
2. Go to the Wordpress Admin Panel and upload the ZIP file in the plugins
screen. Alternatively, you can also manually unzip the ZIP file in the
wordpress/wp-content/plugins folder onto the server.
3. Activate the Rentman plugin.
4. Navigate to WooCommerce -> Rentman in the Wordpress admin panel.
5. Submit your Rentman 4G login credentials to continue.
6. When your credentials have been approved, press the 'Update Products'
(=Import-tab) button to load all products from Rentman and their respective categories.
7. After the import has finished, the plugin will display the tax rates that have
been found in Rentman for the imported products. You have to create your
own tax classes in WooCommerce that match these rates.
8. Finally, check the settings for availability, discounts and stock display.
